## Hello GitHub world ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Jordan

I'm a UK based software engineer passionate about code quality and automating business processes. 

You can typically find me on LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdimov/ 

I've been a fan of Python for over 20 years now. While I sometimes get excited about other languages, Python is likely to remain my professional language of choice for the next 20 years as well. 

In addition to developing software, I also train people and teams to become more productive in software engineering. 

### Ask me about...

- How to start or advance your Python career (especially if you would like to pursue highly paid contracting roles in the UK)
- Using AI language models to make building complex software more enjoyable and productive
- Accounting software. I don't like any of the existing accounting software offerings, so I built my own. It's now HMRC approved and used by accounting firms handling the accounts for thousands of UK businesses. 
- Any other kind of business software. 
- The Mandarin language (I am a student)
- The Arabic language (also a student)
- The purpose of life

## Hello GitHub world ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Jordan

I'm a UK based software engineer passionate about automating business processes in various industries. 

You can typically find me on LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdimov/ (Once you stop thinking of LinkedIn as a career site, it's actually quite nice!)

I've been a fan of Python for over 20 years now and, while I often get excited about other languages, Python is likely to remain my professional language of choice for the next 20 years as well. 

### Ask me about...

- Python. Haha. Or FastAPI. Or Django. 
- AWS (my favourite services are ECS / Fargate, Lambda and RDS / Aurora)
- PostgreSQL
- Accounting software. I don't like any of the existing accounting software offerings, so I built my own. It's now HMRC approved and used by accounting firms handling the accounts for thousands of UK businesses. 
- Any other kind of business software. 
- The Mandarin language (I am a student)
- The Arabic language (also a student)
- The purpose of life

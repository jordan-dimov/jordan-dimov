## Hello GitHub ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Jordan

I'm a UK-based tech entrepreneur and business consultant. 

You can typically find me on LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdimov/ 

I've been a fan of Python for over 25 years now. While I sometimes get excited about other languages, Python is likely to remain my professional language of choice for the next 20 years as well.
